# Project Overview

This repository contains the project files used for a C++ analysis that I worked on previously. Note that this project includes only the files needed to compile the project in **C++ Builder**. 

If you are interested in running the project yourself, make sure to download and use the newest version of C++ Builder (the project was built using Version 12).

3. Once the project is built, you can run it:

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you're using **C++ Builder version 12** or higher to avoid compatibility issues.
