#What is This?

Contains some of the project files that I used for a C++ analysis a while ago. Note that this
project contains only the files used for compiling the project in C++ Builder. If you are 
interested in running the project yourself, download the application for the newest version
of C++ Builder (was built on version 12).

#How do I Build This?
Open the project in C++ Builder by going to File->Open Project->Project1.cbproj. 
Build the project within the app by going to Project->Build Project1

The project should show up when you press the green arrow on the top. It should look like a
VCL Form (like this:)
